Attached is a mockup of the front end for the programming exercise

1. The Classroom Manager is a web application.

2. The application should store and retrieve Class (as in a Class you take in school) and Student data from a database.

3. The Classroom Manager screen will load the Classes into a drop down. When a Class is selected from the drop down it will populate the Teacher field and the list of Students in the class (if any).

4. This screen will not be used to add, remove, or edit Classes or Teachers. So, prepopulate your Classes table with values.

5. This screen will only be used to add new Students to classes. Students cannot be edited or removed from the list.

6. This screen will allow the user to sort the list of Students in Ascending (Asc) or Descending (Desc) order. Storing the Students in Asc or Desc order in the database is not required.

7. The buttons can be any shade of green. When the user hovers over a button with their mouse it should turn to any shade of blue.

8. Please create a readme.txt to document the time spent, any assumptions made, notes youâ€™d like us to be aware of as you developed the application, or even things you would have like to have done given more time.
